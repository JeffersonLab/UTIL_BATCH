I was testing switching the auger job submission scripts over to slurm, but there's one major issue with this.
Slurm cannot handle the "INPUT_FILES" tag in the same way that Auger can. As such, it requires the input files to already be present before execution.
There's no "nice" way to do this, so I decided to drop my work on switching to slurm. If they add in functionality for this in the future, we could look at this.
